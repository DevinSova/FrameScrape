# FrameScrape
_Webscrapes Fighting Game Character Moves from https://www.dustloop.com/wiki/_

---

Outputs a JSON file per game in the /out directory

JSON files are fed into [WatchLoops](https://github.com/DevinSova/WatchLoops) project.

This took a lot of picking apart the HTML Pages

Also ran into tons of issues when CSS for pages got updated (Needed to redo a bunch)

Or even had issues on the same page due to inconsistency!!

Glad I finished this project.

This ended up not being a good solution for the long term.

Learned a bunch about the challenges of webscraping and had fun doing it
